# Untitled Game

This is currently a super early stage 2d puzzle game, where the goal is to strike a set of boxes within a certain time limit using throwing objects to advance to the next level. It's on hold since I got sidetracked by needing to leetcode for interviews.

## How to run

If you're interested in checking out the work in progress, follow the steps below. Movement keys are A: move left, D: move right, Left Click: throw knife, Right Click: throw slow knife

* Using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 14 (LTS) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* Run the `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run the `npm start` to run the development server to test out changes
   * [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) will build the [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) into Javascript
   * [Webpack dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) will host the script in a little server on http://localhost:8080/
